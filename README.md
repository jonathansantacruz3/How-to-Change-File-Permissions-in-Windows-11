<h1>How to Change File Permissions on Windows 11</h1>
This tutorial explains what file permissions are and what the process is on how to change them.<br />

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 11</b> (23H2)

<h2>Explanation & Process Steps</h2>

<h3>What are file permissions?</h3>

Files created on a computer are available to anyone with the right level of access. The level of permission, usually administrator rights, is key to updating file permissions. File permissions allow you to change who can read, write, or modify files within a system. Permissions control access and denial of access within a system or network. File attributes, on the other hand, determine if it is a read-only file or if the file is to remain searchable or hidden. It does not require admin permission to change the attribute of the file and will transfer the attribute when shared. 

<h3>How to change file permissions?</h3>

These steps will walk you through changing file permissions on a Windows 11 computer after signing into the proper account with the right access rights. 
1.	Select the desired file and double-click on it to display a list of options.
2.	From this list, choose the “Properties” option (this will take you to the “General” tab of the file’s properties). 
3.	Navigate to the “Security” tab.
4.	Click on the “Edit” button under the “Group or user names” box. 
5.	Choose the desired group or user to display the permissions they currently have. 
6.	In the permissions box, you have the option to check the boxes in the ALLOW or DENY column. (checking a box in the ALLOW column grants them that permission and a check in the DENY column cancels that permission).
7.	After you designate permissions, click on “Apply”, and then “OK” to make the changes.

<h3>Adding a user to file permissions.</h3>

When a user is not listed in the box, manually adding them is a simple procedure. If you are going this route, it’s best to know that the user will automatically have limited or no permissions because it wasn’t an original member of the group that had access to the file.  These next steps help add a new user. 

1.	Go over to the file and right-click it to display “Properties” in the options list. 
2.	Select “Properties”.
3.	Choose the “Security” tab. 
4.	Navigate towards the “Edit” button and click it. 
5.	Select the “Add” button. 
6.	In this new window, type in the name of the new user in the “Enter the object name to select” box. 
7.	Click on “Check Names”.
8.	After it is validated in the system, press “OK”. 
9.	The new user will now appear in the list of “groups or user names” box, and once selected can set permissions for this user. 
10.	Once the permissions are set, click on “Apply”.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

Permissions can be an important system to implement the principle of least privilege to safeguard against malicious behavior, data protection, and fault tolerance. Always be careful when setting file permissions and allowing or denying files to certain people. We are all human, and we make mistakes so deleting important files can also happen. In other words, leave it to the professionals to set these systems in place and if you are the administrator, make sure to document and communicate what has changed.
